# 🔌 Fi MCP Server Management Enhancements

## 🎯 What We Enhanced

Your startup system now includes **comprehensive Fi MCP server verification and management** to ensure the financial data backend is always running properly.

## 🔥 New Fi MCP Server Features

### **🚀 Enhanced start.sh Script**
- **Pre-startup Go verification** - Checks Go installation before attempting to start
- **Project structure validation** - Ensures fi-mcp-server directory exists
- **Multiple detection methods** - Uses netcat, curl, and process checking
- **Post-startup verification** - Confirms MCP server is actually responding
- **Clear status reporting** - Shows exactly what's working and what isn't
- **Platform-specific guidance** - Installation instructions for macOS/Linux

### **🔍 New check_mcp.sh Utility**
- **Standalone MCP management** - Dedicated script for Fi MCP server operations
- **Multiple commands** - status, start, stop, restart
- **Comprehensive checking** - Process, port, and HTTP response verification
- **Smart troubleshooting** - Identifies common issues and provides solutions
- **Detailed feedback** - Clear success/failure messages with guidance

## 🛠️ Available Commands

### **🚀 Complete System with MCP Verification**
```bash
# Start everything with full MCP verification
./start.sh

# The script now automatically:
# 1. Checks if Go is installed
# 2. Verifies fi-mcp-server directory exists
# 3. Starts Fi MCP Server
# 4. Waits for it to respond on port 8080
# 5. Provides clear success/failure feedback
```

### **🔍 Fi MCP Server Management**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
./check_mcp.sh                    # Default: status check
./check_mcp.sh status             # Explicit status check

# Start MCP server only
./check_mcp.sh start              # Starts and verifies

# Stop MCP server
./check_mcp.sh stop               # Stops and cleans up port

# Restart MCP server
./check_mcp.sh restart            # Stop + Start + Verify

# Get help
./check_mcp.sh help               # Usage instructions
```

## 📊 Enhanced Verification Process

### **🔍 Multi-Layer MCP Server Detection**

#### **1. Process Detection**
```bash
# Checks if "go run main.go" process is running
pgrep -f "go run main.go"
```

#### **2. Port Verification**
```bash
# Method 1: Using netcat (if available)
nc -z localhost 8080

# Method 2: Using curl (if available)
curl -s --connect-timeout 3 http://localhost:8080

# Method 3: Process fallback
# If tools not available, relies on process detection
```

#### **3. HTTP Response Check**
```bash
# Verifies server actually responds to HTTP requests
curl -s --connect-timeout 3 http://localhost:8080
```

#### **4. Port Cleanup**
```bash
# Identifies what's using port 8080 if conflicts occur
lsof -ti:8080
```

## 🎯 Real-World Usage Scenarios

### **🆕 First-Time Setup**
```bash
# User runs on fresh machine
./start.sh

# Output includes:
# 🔍 Verifying system prerequisites...
# ✅ Go found: go version go1.21.0 darwin/arm64
# 🚀 Starting complete system...
# 🔍 Final system verification...
# ✅ Fi MCP Server responding on port 8080
# 🎉 System startup completed successfully!
```

### **🐛 Troubleshooting Scenario**
```bash
# MCP server not responding
./check_mcp.sh status

# Output:
# ❌ Fi MCP Server process not found
# 💡 To start Fi MCP Server:
#    ./start.sh                    # Start complete system
#    cd fi-mcp-server && go run main.go  # Start MCP only
```

### **🔧 Development Workflow**
```bash
# Check MCP status quickly
./check_mcp.sh

# Restart just the MCP server
./check_mcp.sh restart

# Stop MCP server for maintenance
./check_mcp.sh stop
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Recovery

### **🔍 Automatic Problem Detection**

#### **Missing Go Installation**
```bash
# Detected and handled automatically
❌ Go not found! Fi MCP Server requires Go.
📥 Install Go:
   macOS: brew install go
   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install golang-go
   CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install golang
   Or download from: https://golang.org/dl/
```

#### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Identified and resolved
⚠️  Port 8080 is occupied by process: 12345
   You may need to run: ./start.sh --cleanup-only
```

#### **Directory Issues**
```bash
# Project structure validation
❌ fi-mcp-server directory not found!
   Make sure you're in the correct project directory.
```

### **🩺 Self-Healing Features**

#### **Automatic Cleanup**
```bash
# Before starting, cleans up any conflicting processes
🧹 Cleaning up existing processes...
Killed process 7362 on port 8080
```

#### **Intelligent Retry**
```bash
# Waits up to 20 seconds for MCP server to respond
⏳ Waiting for Fi MCP Server to start...
✅ Fi MCP Server detected on port 8080
```

#### **Graceful Degradation**
```bash
# If verification tools missing, still works
✅ Process detected (cannot verify port without curl/nc)
🎉 Fi MCP Server appears to be running!
```
